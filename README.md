# Simple Encryption/Decryption Tool using Caesar Cipher

A Python-based tool that implements the **Caesar Cipher** encryption and decryption algorithm. The tool allows users to encrypt or decrypt messages by shifting characters in the alphabet by a user-defined value.

## Features

- **Caesar Cipher Encryption**: Encrypts text by shifting each alphabetic character by a specified number.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts the encrypted text by reversing the shift.
- **Custom Shift Value**: Allows users to specify the shift value for both encryption and decryption.
- **Handles Both Uppercase and Lowercase Letters**: The cipher works for both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- **Non-Alphabetic Characters**: Non-alphabetic characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) remain unchanged during encryption and decryption.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Python 3.x
Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Download the Script

You can either clone this repository or download the script directly. To clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ParthXD7/Simple-Caesar-Cipher-Encryption-Decryption.git
cd Simple-Caesar-Cipher-Encryption-Decryption
```

### Step 3: Run the Script

Once you've downloaded or cloned the repository, run the Python script:

```bash
python caesar_cipher_tool.py
```

## Usage

Upon running the tool, you’ll be prompted to choose between encryption or decryption, input your text, and specify the shift value. The tool will then display the encrypted or decrypted result.

### Example Usage

#### Encrypting a Message:
```plaintext
Welcome to the Simple Encryption/Decryption Tool!
Would you like to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt? E
Enter the text: Hello World!
Enter the shift value (integer): 3
Encrypted text: Khoor Zruog!
```

#### Decrypting a Message:
```plaintext
Would you like to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt? D
Enter the text: Khoor Zruog!
Enter the shift value (integer): 3
Decrypted text: Hello World!
```

### How it Works:

1. **Encryption**: Each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a specified number of positions in the alphabet. For example, a shift of 3 turns 'A' into 'D', 'B' into 'E', and so on.
2. **Decryption**: The encrypted text is shifted in the opposite direction by the specified shift value to return to the original plaintext.

### Example Explanation:
- For **"Hello World!"** with a shift of 3:
  - `H` becomes `K`
  - `e` becomes `h`
  - `l` becomes `o`
  - `o` becomes `r`
  - `W` becomes `Z`
  - `r` becomes `u`
  - `l` becomes `o`
  - `d` becomes `g`
  - Non-alphabetic characters (like spaces or punctuation) remain unchanged.
  
  The encrypted message will be **"Khoor Zruog!"**.

## Code Structure

- **`encrypt()`**: This function takes the plaintext and the shift value, and returns the encrypted text by shifting each alphabetic character.
- **`decrypt()`**: This function takes the encrypted text and the shift value, and returns the decrypted text by reversing the shift.
- **`main()`**: The main function that drives the program by interacting with the user, taking input, and calling the appropriate functions for encryption or decryption.
